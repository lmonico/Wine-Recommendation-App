<p>
  Hello! Welcome to Diego Castaneda's, Lukas Monico's, Jason Ryan's, and Harsh Patel's
  2019 Big Data project. We created an item-item <strong>recommender system</strong>  with a wine
  review dataset. You are able to view different wine reviews on the
  <a routerLink="../dashboard"> Dashboard</a>
  page. From the review details page, you are able to see similar wines based
  on the attributes of the wine you are viewing.
